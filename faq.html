                            <p>We currently provide services across metropolitan Melbourne and select regional areas. Our team operates in both metropolitan and regional locations, with some services available remotely via telehealth.</p>

                        <div class="answer">
                            <p>We aim to begin services within 2 weeks of initial contact for most supports. For urgent cases, we can often arrange temporary supports within 48 hours while we complete the full assessment process.</p>
                            <p>The exact timeline depends on your specific needs, current plan status, and any required assessments. Our team will provide a clear timeline during your initial consultation.</p>

                        <div class="answer">
                            <p>We carefully match participants with support workers based on personality, interests, skills required, and cultural considerations. You'll have the opportunity to meet potential support workers before services begin.</p>
                            <p>If a match isn't working well, we'll work with you to find a better fit - your comfort and compatibility are our priorities.</p>

                            <p>You can change or cancel services at any time - we require just 48 hours notice for most changes. There are no long-term contracts or cancellation fees.</p>
                            <p>We understand that needs change, and we'll work with you to adjust your supports accordingly. Our priority is ensuring you have the right services at the right time.</p>

                        <div class="answer">
                            <p>Yes, our support coordinators can assist with preparing for your plan review by helping document your progress, changing needs, and any required evidence for continued funding.</p>
                            <p>We can also attend review meetings with you (in person or virtually) to advocate for your needs.</p>

                        <div class="answer">
                            <p>Support coordination helps you understand and implement your plan, connect with providers, and build your capacity to manage supports. Plan management handles the financial aspects - paying providers, tracking budgets, and completing NDIS paperwork.</p>
                            <p>Many participants benefit from having both services, but you can choose either or neither depending on your needs and preferences.</p>
